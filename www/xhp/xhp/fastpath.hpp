/**
 * Provides a fast way to scan over a buffer and figure out whether or not it
 * contains code that XHP needs to rewrite. This is valuable because the full
 * XHP parser is a lot more expensive to run. Since we assume (for now) that
 * most files won't contain XHP this fast fail greatly speeds up overal parse
 * times.
 *
 * The nature of this function is that it still may return false positives since
 * it only runs a simple lexical analysis on the source text. Particularly,
 * ternary operators returning numbers or constants with no spaces in between
 * tokens can fool it. i.e. `$foo = true ? 1:2` or `$foo = true ? foo:bar`.
 * That's not to say you should change your coding conventions because of this,
 * since it has no side effect other than slightly-slower parsing. Instead you
 * should install APC or something.
 *
 * Note that at this point the `len` parameter is just a formality and `yy` MUST
 * be NULL terminated. re2c doesn't provide any dependable means to scan a
 * buffer with no sentinal value. So for instance, if you want to use this on an
 * mmap'd file you must read it into memory first.
 *
 * Furthermore, it seems the primary maintainer of re2c doesn't want to
 * implement this, so we have to work around it for now.
 *
 * See: re2c-Support Requests-2407218 --
 * http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=616201&aid=2407218&group_id=96864
