# HHVM Vagrant box

Ubuntu Precise box simply installing HHVM (nightly) via apt.

Find more details on the examples found in the [www](https://github.com/vicb/hhvm-vagrant/tree/master/www)
folder by reading the associated SitePoint article "HHVM and Hack â€“ Can We
Expect Them to Replace PHP?" [part 1](http://www.sitepoint.com/hhvm-hack-part-1/)
and [part 2](http://www.sitepoint.com/look-hack-php-replacement-hhvm/).

## Requirements

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vicb/hhvm-vagrant.git
$ cd hhvm-vagrant
$ vagrant up
```

Once the VM is booted you can log via SSH

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
$ ...
```

The server root folder is `/vagrant/www` (on the map) which is the `www` folder
on your host machine.

- The HHVM server is available at `http://localhost:8080` on the host OS
- The HHVM admin server is available at `http://localhost:8100` on the host OS,
  the password is "admin"
- A MySQL server is installed. The root user is "root" with password "pa$$".

## Usage

Check the [bootstraping guide](http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/install.hack.bootstrapping.php)
and the [HHVM docs](http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/index.php).

## HHVM Server Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration, edit the `conf/php.ini` file. The hdf
format is deprecated and support will be dropped (`conf/config.hdf`).

You can find more information on the configuration format:
- On the [HHVM wiki at github](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Runtime-options),
- In the [HHVM docs](http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/configuration.file.php).

The access and error logs are available in `/var/log/hhvm`

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
$ tail -f /var/log/hhvm/access.log
$ tail -f /var/log/hhvm/error.log
```

## Virtual Machine Management

When done just log out with `^D` and suspend the virtual machine

```bash
$ vagrant suspend
```

then, resume to testing again

```bash
$ vagrant resume
```

Run

```bash
$ vagrant halt
```

to shutdown the virtual machine, and

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

to boot it again.

You can find out the state of a virtual machine anytime by invoking

```bash
$ vagrant status
```

Finally, to completely wipe the virtual machine from the disk **destroying all
its contents**:

```bash
$ vagrant destroy
```
